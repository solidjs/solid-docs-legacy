While `lazy` and `createResource` can be used on their own, Solid also provides a mechanism for coordinating the display of multiple async events. `Suspense` serves as a boundary that can show a fallback placeholder instead of the partially loaded content as these async events resolve.

This can improve user experience by removing visual jank caused by too many intermediate and partial loading states. `Suspense` automatically detects any descendant async reads and acts accordingly. You can nest as many `Suspense` components as needed and only the nearest ancestor will transform to fallback when loading state is detected.

Let's add `Suspense` component to our lazy loading example.

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
    <Greeting name="Jake" />
  </Suspense>
</>
```

Now we have a loading placeholder.

It's important to note that it's the read of an async derived value that triggers `Suspense`. Not the async fetching itself. If a resource signal (including `lazy` components) is not read under the `Suspense` boundary it will not suspend.

`Suspense` in many ways is just a `Show` component that renders both branches. While `Suspense` is vital for asynchronous Server rendering do not feel the need to jump immediately to using it for client-rendered code. Solid's fine-grained rendering has no additional cost for splitting things manually.

```jsx
function Deferred(props) {
  const [resume, setResume] = createSignal(false);
  setTimeout(() => setResume(true), 0);

  return <Show when={resume()}>{props.children}</Show>;
}
```

All work in Solid is queued independently already. No need for things like Time Slicing.
