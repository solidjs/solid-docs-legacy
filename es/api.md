# Basic Reactivity

## `createSignal`

```ts
export function createSignal<T>(
  value: T,
  options?: { name?: string; equals?: false | ((prev: T, next: T) => boolean) }
): [get: () => T, set: (v: T) => T];
```

This is the most basic reactive primitive used to track a single value that changes over time. The create function returns a get and set pair of functions to access and update the signal.

```js
const [getValue, setValue] = createSignal(initialValue);

// read value
getValue();

// set value
setValue(nextValue);

// set value with a function setter
setValue((prev) => prev + next);
```

Remember to access signals under a tracking scope if you wish them to react to updates. Tracking scopes are functions that are passed to computations like `createEffect` or JSX expressions.

> If you wish to store a function in a Signal you must use the function form:
>
> ```js
> setValue(() => myFunction);
> ```

## `createEffect`

```ts
export function createEffect<T>(
  fn: (v: T) => T,
  value?: T,
  options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

Creates a new computation that automatically tracks dependencies and runs after each render where a dependency has changed. Ideal for using `ref`s and managing other side effects.

```js
const [a, setA] = createSignal(initialValue);

// effect that depends on signal `a`
createEffect(() => doSideEffect(a()));
```

The effect function is called with the value returned from the effect function's last execution. This value can be initialized as an optional 2nd argument. This can be useful for diffing without creating an additional closure.

```js
createEffect((prev) => {
  const sum = a() + b();
  if (sum !== prev) console.log(sum);
  return sum;
}, 0);
```

## `createMemo`

```ts
export function createMemo<T>(
  fn: (v: T) => T,
  value?: T,
  options?: { name?: string; equals?: false | ((prev: T, next: T) => boolean) }
): () => T;
```

Creates a readonly derived signal that recalculates its value whenever the executed code's dependencies update.

```js
const getValue = createMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a(), b()));

// read value
getValue();
```

The memo function is called with the value returned from the memo function's last execution. This value can be initialized as an optional 2nd argument. This is useful for reducing computations.

```js
const sum = createMemo((prev) => input() + prev, 0);
```

## `createResource`

```ts
type ResourceReturn<T> = [
  {
    (): T | undefined;
    loading: boolean;
    error: any;
  },
  {
    mutate: (v: T | undefined) => T | undefined;
    refetch: () => void;
  }
];

export function createResource<T, U = true>(
  fetcher: (k: U, getPrev: () => T | undefined) => T | Promise<T>,
  options?: { initialValue?: T; name?: string }
): ResourceReturn<T>;

export function createResource<T, U>(
  source: U | false | null | (() => U | false | null),
  fetcher: (k: U, getPrev: () => T | undefined) => T | Promise<T>,
  options?: { initialValue?: T; name?: string }
): ResourceReturn<T>;
```

Creates a signal that can manage async requests. The `fetcher` is an async function that accepts return value of the `source` if provided and returns a Promise whose resolved value is set in the resource. The fetcher is not reactive so use the optional first argument if you want it to run more than once. If the source resolves to false, null, or undefined will not to fetch.

```js
const [data, { mutate, refetch }] = createResource(getQuery, fetchData);

// read value
data();

// check if loading
data.loading;

// check if errored
data.error;

// directly set value without creating promise
mutate(optimisticValue);

// refetch last request just because
refetch();
```

`loading` and `error` are reactive getters and can be tracked.

# Lifecycles

## `onMount`

```ts
export function onMount(fn: () => void): void;
```

Registers a method that runs after initial render and elements have been mounted. Ideal for using `ref`s and managing other one time side effects. It is equivalent to a `createEffect` which does not have any dependencies.

## `onCleanup`

```ts
export function onCleanup(fn: () => void): void;
```

Registers a cleanup method that executes on disposal or recalculation of the current reactive scope. Can be used in any Component or Effect.

## `onError`

```ts
export function onError(fn: (err: any) => void): void;
```

Registers an error handler method that executes when child scope errors. Only the nearest scope error handlers execute. Rethrow to trigger up the line.

# Reactive Utilities

These helpers provide the ability to better schedule updates and control how reactivity is tracked.

## `untrack`

```ts
export function untrack<T>(fn: () => T): T;
```

Ignores tracking any of the dependencies in the executing code block and returns the value.

## `batch`

```ts
export function batch<T>(fn: () => T): T;
```

Holds committing updates within the block until the end to prevent unnecessary recalculation. This means that reading values on the next line will not have updated yet. [Solid Store](#createstore)'s set method and Effects automatically wrap their code in a batch.

## `on`

```ts
export function on<T extends Array<() => any> | (() => any), U>(
  deps: T,
  fn: (input: T, prevInput: T, prevValue?: U) => U,
  options: { defer?: boolean } = {}
): (prevValue?: U) => U | undefined;
```

`on` is designed to be passed into a computation to make its dependencies explicit. If an array of dependencies is passed, `input` and `prevInput` are arrays.

```js
createEffect(on(a, (v) => console.log(v, b())));

// is equivalent to:
createEffect(() => {
  const v = a();
  untrack(() => console.log(v, b()));
});
```

You can also not run the computation immediately and instead opt in for it to only run on change by setting the defer option to true.

```js
// doesn't run immediately
createEffect(on(a, (v) => console.log(v), { defer: true }));

setA("new"); // now it runs
```

## `createRoot`

```ts
export function createRoot<T>(fn: (dispose: () => void) => T): T;
```

Creates a new non-tracked context that doesn't auto-dispose. This is useful for nested reactive contexts that you do not wish to release when the parent re-evaluates. It is a powerful pattern for caching.

All Solid code should be wrapped in one of these top level as they ensure that all memory/computations are freed up. Normally you do not need to worry about this as `createRoot` is embedded into all `render` entry functions.

## `mergeProps`

```ts
export function mergeProps(...sources: any): any;
```

A reactive object `merge` method. Useful for setting default props for components in case caller doesn't provide them. Or cloning the props object including reactive properties.

This method works by using a proxy and resolving properties in reverse order. This allows for dynamic tracking of properties that aren't present when the prop object is first merged.

```js
// default props
props = mergeProps({ name: "Smith" }, props);

// clone props
newProps = mergeProps(props);

// merge props
props = mergeProps(props, otherProps);
```

## `splitProps`

```ts
export function splitProps<T>(
  props: T,
  ...keys: Array<(keyof T)[]>
): [...parts: Partial<T>];
```

This is the replacement for destructuring. It splits a reactive object by keys while maintaining reactivity.

```js
const [local, others] = splitProps(props, ["children"]);

<>
  <Child {...others} />
  <div>{local.children}<div>
</>
```

## `useTransition`

```ts
export function useTransition(): [
  () => boolean,
  (fn: () => void, cb?: () => void) => void
];
```

Used to batch async updates in a transaction deferring commit until all async processes are complete. This is tied into Suspense and only tracks resources read under Suspense boundaries.

```js
const [isPending, start] = useTransition();

// check if transitioning
isPending();

// wrap in transition
start(() => setSignal(newValue), () => /* transition is done */)
```

## `observable`

```ts
export function observable<T>(input: () => T): Observable<T>;
```

This method takes a signal and produces a simple Observable. Consume it from the Observable library of your choice with typically with the `from` operator.

```js
import { from } from "rxjs";

const [s, set] = createSignal(0);

const obsv$ = from(observable(s));

obsv$.subscribe((v) => console.log(v));
```

## `mapArray`

```ts
export function mapArray<T, U>(
  list: () => readonly T[],
  mapFn: (v: T, i: () => number) => U
): () => U[];
```

Reactive map helper that caches each item by reference to reduce unnecessary mapping on updates. It only runs the mapping function once per value and then moves or removes it as needed. The index argument is a signal. The map function itself is not tracking.

Underlying helper for the `<For>` control flow.

```js
const mapped = mapArray(source, (model) => {
  const [name, setName] = createSignal(model.name);
  const [description, setDescription] = createSignal(model.description);

  return {
    id: model.id,
    get name() {
      return name();
    },
    get description() {
      return description();
    }
    setName,
    setDescription
  }
});
```

## `indexArray`

```ts
export function indexArray<T, U>(
  list: () => readonly T[],
  mapFn: (v: () => T, i: number) => U
): () => U[];
```

Similar to `mapArray` except it maps by index. The item is a signal and the index is now the constant.

Underlying helper for the `<Index>` control flow.

```js
const mapped = indexArray(source, (model) => {
  return {
    get id() {
      return model().id
    }
    get firstInitial() {
      return model().firstName[0];
    },
    get fullName() {
      return `${model().firstName} ${model().lastName}`;
    },
  }
});
```

# Stores

These APIs are available at `solid-js/store`.

## `createStore`

```ts
export function createStore<T extends StoreNode>(
  state: T | Store<T>,
  options?: { name?: string }
): [get: Store<T>, set: SetStoreFunction<T>];
```

This creates a tree of Signals as proxy that allows individual values in nested data structures to be independently tracked. The create function returns a readonly proxy object, and a setter function.

```js
const [state, setState] = createStore(initialValue);

// read value
state.someValue;

// set value
setState({ merge: "thisValue" });

setState("path", "to", "value", newValue);
```

Store objects being proxies only track on property access. And on access Stores recursively produces nested Store objects on nested data. However it only wraps arrays and plain objects. Classes are not wrapped. So things like `Date`, `HTMLElement`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set` are not granularly reactive. Additionally, the top level state object cannot be tracked without accessing a property on it. So it is not suitable to use for things you iterate over as adding new keys or indexes cannot trigger updates. So put any lists on a key of state rather than trying to use the state object itself.

```js
// put the list as a key on the state object
const [state, setState] = createStore({ list: [] });

// access the `list` property on the state object
<For each={state.list}>{item => /*...*/}</For>
```

### Getters

Store objects support the use of getters to store calculated values.

```js
const [state, setState] = createStore({
  user: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    },
  },
});
```

These are simple getters, so you still need to use a Memo if you want to cache a value;

```js
let fullName;
const [state, setState] = createStore({
  user: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    get fullName() {
      return fullName();
    },
  },
});
fullName = createMemo(() => `${state.user.firstName} ${state.user.lastName}`);
```

### Updating Stores

Changes can take the form of function that passes previous state and returns new state or a value. Objects are always shallowly merged. Set values to `undefined` to delete them from the Store.

```js
const [state, setState] = createStore({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Miller",
});

setState({ firstName: "Johnny", middleName: "Lee" });
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Miller' })

setState((state) => ({ preferredName: state.firstName, lastName: "Milner" }));
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', preferredName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Milner' })
```

It supports paths including key arrays, object ranges, and filter functions.

setState also supports nested setting where you can indicate the path to the change. When nested the state you are updating may be other non Object values. Objects are still merged but other values (including Arrays) are replaced.

```js
const [state, setState] = createStore({
  counter: 2,
  list: [
    { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
    { id: 27, title: 'Fish' }
  ]
});

setState('counter', c => c + 1);
setState('list', l => [...l, {id: 43, title: 'Marsupials'}]);
setState('list', 2, 'read', true);
// {
//   counter: 3,
//   list: [
//     { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
//     { id: 27, title: 'Fish' }
//     { id: 43, title: 'Marsupials', read: true }
//   ]
// }
```

Path can be string keys, array of keys, iterating objects ({from, to, by}), or filter functions. This gives incredible expressive power to describe state changes.

```js
const [state, setState] = createStore({
  todos: [
    { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
    { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: false }
    { task: 'Make dinner', completed: false }
  ]
});

setState('todos', [0, 2], 'completed', true);
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Make dinner', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', { from: 0, to: 1 }, 'completed', c => !c);
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', todo => todo.completed, 'task', t => t + '!')
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping!', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner!', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', {}, todo => ({ marked: true, completed: !todo.completed }))
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: true, marked: true }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping!', completed: false, marked: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner!', completed: false, marked: true }
//   ]
// }
```

## `produce`

```ts
export function produce<T>(
  fn: (state: T) => void
): (
  state: T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>
) => T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>;
```

Immer inspired API for Solid's Store objects that allows for localized mutation.

```js
setState(
  produce((s) => {
    s.user.name = "Frank";
    s.list.push("Pencil Crayon");
  })
);
```

## `reconcile`

```ts
export function reconcile<T>(
  value: T | Store<T>,
  options?: {
    key?: string | null;
    merge?: boolean;
  } = { key: "id" }
): (
  state: T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>
) => T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>;
```

Diffs data changes when we can't apply granular updates. Useful for when dealing with immutable data from stores or large API responses.

The key is used when available to match items. By default `merge` false does referential checks where possible to determine equality and replaces where items are not referentially equal. `merge` true pushes all diffing to the leaves and effectively morphs the previous data to the new value.

```js
// subscribing to an observable
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(({ todos }) => (
  setState('todos', reconcile(todos)));
);
onCleanup(() => unsubscribe());
```

## `createMutable`

```ts
export function createMutable<T extends StoreNode>(
  state: T | Store<T>,
  options?: { name?: string }
): Store<T> {
```

Creates a new mutable Store proxy object. Stores only trigger updates on values changing. Tracking is done by intercepting property access and automatically tracks deep nesting via proxy.

Useful for integrating external systems or as a compatibility layer with MobX/Vue.

> **Note:** A mutable state can be passed around and mutated anywhere, which can make it harder to follow and easier to break unidirectional flow. It is generally recommended to use `createStore` instead. The `produce` modifier can give many of the same benefits without any of the downsides.

```js
const state = createMutable(initialValue);

// read value
state.someValue;

// set value
state.someValue = 5;

state.list.push(anotherValue);
```

Mutables support setters along with getters.

```js
const user = createMutable({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Smith",
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
  set fullName(value) {
    [this.firstName, this.lastName] = value.split(" ");
  },
});
```

# Component APIs

## `createContext`

```ts
interface Context<T> {
  id: symbol;
  Provider: (props: { value: T; children: any }) => any;
  defaultValue: T;
}
export function createContext<T>(defaultValue?: T): Context<T | undefined>;
```

Context provides a form of dependency injection in Solid. It is used to save from needing to pass data as props through intermediate components.

This function creates a new context object that can be used with `useContext` and provides the `Provider` control flow. Default Context is used when no `Provider` is found above in the hierarchy.

```js
export const CounterContext = createContext([{ count: 0 }, {}]);

export function CounterProvider(props) {
  const [state, setState] = createStore({ count: props.count || 0 });
  const store = [
    state,
    {
      increment() {
        setState("count", (c) => c + 1);
      },
      decrement() {
        setState("count", (c) => c - 1);
      },
    },
  ];

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={store}>
      {props.children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

The value passed to provider is passed to `useContext` as is. That means wrapping as a reactive expression will not work. You should pass in Signals and Stores directly instead of accessing them in the JSX.

## `useContext`

```ts
export function useContext<T>(context: Context<T>): T;
```

Used to grab context to allow for deep passing of props without having to pass them through each Component function.

```js
const [state, { increment, decrement }] = useContext(CounterContext);
```

## `children`

```ts
export function children(fn: () => any): () => any;
```

Used to make it easier to interact with `props.children`. This helper resolves any nested reactivity and returns a memo. Recommended approach to using `props.children` in anything other than passing directly through to JSX.

```js
const list = children(() => props.children);

// do something with them
createEffect(() => list());
```

## `lazy`

```ts
export function lazy<T extends Component<any>>(
  fn: () => Promise<{ default: T }>
): T & { preload: () => Promise<T> };
```

Used to lazy load components to allow for code splitting. Components are not loaded until rendered. Lazy loaded components can be used the same as its statically imported counterpart, receiving props etc... Lazy components trigger `<Suspense>`

```js
// wrap import
const ComponentA = lazy(() => import("./ComponentA"));

// use in JSX
<ComponentA title={props.title} />;
```

# Secondary Primitives

You probably won't need them for your first app, but these useful tools to have.

## `createDeferred`

```ts
export function createDeferred<T>(
  source: () => T,
  options?: {
    timeoutMs?: number;
    name?: string;
    equals?: false | ((prev: T, next: T) => boolean);
  }
): () => T;
```

Creates a readonly that only notifies downstream changes when the browser is idle. `timeoutMs` is the maximum time to wait before forcing the update.

## `createComputed`

```ts
export function createComputed<T>(
  fn: (v: T) => T,
  value?: T,
  options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

Creates a new computation that automatically tracks dependencies and runs immediately before render. Use this to write to other reactive primitives. When possible use `createMemo` instead as writing to a signal mid update can cause other computations to need to re-calculate.

## `createRenderEffect`

```ts
export function createRenderEffect<T>(
  fn: (v: T) => T,
  value?: T,
  options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

Creates a new computation that automatically tracks dependencies and runs during the render phase as DOM elements are created and updated but not necessarily connected. All internal DOM updates happen at this time.

## `createSelector`

```ts
export function createSelector<T, U>(
  source: () => T,
  fn?: (a: U, b: T) => boolean,
  options?: { name?: string }
): (k: U) => boolean;
```

Creates a conditional signal that only notifies subscribers when entering or exiting their key matching the value. Useful for delegated selection state. As it makes the operation O(2) instead of O(n).

```js
const isSelected = createSelector(selectedId);

<For each={list()}>
  {(item) => <li classList={{ active: isSelected(item.id) }}>{item.name}</li>}
</For>;
```

# Rendering

These imports are exposed from `solid-js/web`.

## `render`

```ts
export function render(
  code: () => JSX.Element,
  element: MountableElement
): () => void;
```

This is the browser app entry point. Provide a top level component definition or function and an element to mount to. It is recommended this element be empty as the returned dispose function will wipe all children.

```js
const dispose = render(App, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## `hydrate`

```ts
export function hydrate(
  fn: () => JSX.Element,
  node: MountableElement
): () => void;
```

This method is similar to `render` except it attempts to rehydrate what is already rendered to the DOM. When initializing in the browser a page has already been server rendered.

```js
const dispose = hydrate(App, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## `renderToString`

```ts
export function renderToString<T>(
  fn: () => T,
  options?: {
    eventNames?: string[];
    nonce?: string;
  }
): string;
```

Renders to a string synchronously. The function also generates a script tag for progressive hydration. Options include eventNames to listen to before the page loads and play back on hydration, and nonce to put on the script tag.

```js
const html = renderToString(App);
```

## `renderToStringAsync`

```ts
export function renderToStringAsync<T>(
  fn: () => T,
  options?: {
    eventNames?: string[];
    timeoutMs?: number;
    nonce?: string;
  }
): Promise<string>;
```

Same as `renderToString` except it will wait for all `<Suspense>` boundaries to resolve before returning the results. Resource data is automatically serialized into the script tag and will be hydrated on client load.

```js
const html = await renderToStringAsync(App);
```

## `pipeToNodeWritable`

```ts
export type PipeToWritableResults = {
  startWriting: () => void;
  write: (v: string) => void;
  abort: () => void;
};
export function pipeToNodeWritable<T>(
  fn: () => T,
  writable: { write: (v: string) => void },
  options?: {
    eventNames?: string[];
    nonce?: string;
    noScript?: boolean;
    onReady?: (r: PipeToWritableResults) => void;
    onComplete?: (r: PipeToWritableResults) => void | Promise<void>;
  }
): void;
```

This method renders to a Node stream. It renders the content synchronously including any Suspense fallback placeholders, and then continues to stream the data from any async resource as it completes.

```js
pipeToNodeWritable(App, res);
```

The `onReady` option is useful for writing into the stream around the the core app rendering. Remember if you use `onReady` to manually call `startWriting`.

## `pipeToWritable`

```ts
export type PipeToWritableResults = {
  write: (v: string) => void;
  abort: () => void;
  script: string;
};
export function pipeToWritable<T>(
  fn: () => T,
  writable: WritableStream,
  options?: {
    eventNames?: string[];
    nonce?: string;
    noScript?: boolean;
    onReady?: (
      writable: { write: (v: string) => void },
      r: PipeToWritableResults
    ) => void;
    onComplete?: (
      writable: { write: (v: string) => void },
      r: PipeToWritableResults
    ) => void;
  }
): void;
```

This method renders to a web stream. It renders the content synchronously including any Suspense fallback placeholders, and then continues to stream the data from any async resource as it completes.

```js
const { readable, writable } = new TransformStream();
pipeToWritable(App, writable);
```

The `onReady` option is useful for writing into the stream around the the core app rendering. Remember if you use `onReady` to manually call `startWriting`.

## `isServer`

```ts
export const isServer: boolean;
```

This indicates that the code is being run as the server or browser bundle. As the underlying runtimes export this as a constant boolean it allows bundlers to eliminate the code and their used imports from the respective bundles.

```js
if (isServer) {
  // I will never make it to the browser bundle
} else {
  // won't be run on the server;
}
```

# Control Flow

Solid uses components for control flow. The reason is that with reactivity to be performant we have to control how elements are created. For example with lists, a simple `map` is inefficient as it always maps everything. This means helper functions.

Wrapping these in components is convenient way for terse templating and allows users to compose and build their own control flows.

These built-in control flows will be automatically imported. All except `Portal` and `Dynamic` are exported from `solid-js`. Those two which are DOM specific are exported by `solid-js/web`.

> Note: All callback/render function children of control flow are non-tracking. This allows for nesting state creation, and better isolates reactions.

## `<For>`

```ts
export function For<T, U extends JSX.Element>(props: {
  each: readonly T[];
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: (item: T, index: () => number) => U;
}): () => U[];
```

Simple referentially keyed loop control flow.

```jsx
<For each={state.list} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {(item) => <div>{item}</div>}
</For>
```

Optional second argument is an index signal:

```jsx
<For each={state.list} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {(item, index) => (
    <div>
      #{index()} {item}
    </div>
  )}
</For>
```

## `<Show>`

```ts
function Show<T>(props: {
  when: T | undefined | null | false;
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: JSX.Element | ((item: T) => JSX.Element);
}): () => JSX.Element;
```

The Show control flow is used to conditional render part of the view: it renders `children` when the `when` is truthy, an `fallback` otherwise. It is similar to the ternary operator (`when ? children : fallback`) but is ideal for templating JSX.

```jsx
<Show when={state.count > 0} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <div>My Content</div>
</Show>
```

Show can also be used as a way of keying blocks to a specific data model. Ex the function is re-executed whenever the user model is replaced.

```jsx
<Show when={state.user} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {(user) => <div>{user.firstName}</div>}
</Show>
```

## `<Switch>`/`<Match>`

```ts
export function Switch(props: {
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: JSX.Element;
}): () => JSX.Element;

type MatchProps<T> = {
  when: T | undefined | null | false;
  children: JSX.Element | ((item: T) => JSX.Element);
};
export function Match<T>(props: MatchProps<T>);
```

Useful for when there are more than 2 mutual exclusive conditions. Can be used to do things like simple routing.

```jsx
<Switch fallback={<div>Not Found</div>}>
  <Match when={state.route === "home"}>
    <Home />
  </Match>
  <Match when={state.route === "settings"}>
    <Settings />
  </Match>
</Switch>
```

Match also supports function children to serve as keyed flow.

## `<Index>`

```ts
export function Index<T, U extends JSX.Element>(props: {
  each: readonly T[];
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: (item: () => T, index: number) => U;
}): () => U[];
```

Non-keyed list iteration (rows keyed to index). This is useful when there is no conceptual key, like if the data consists of primitives and it is the index that is fixed rather than the value.

The item is a signal:

```jsx
<Index each={state.list} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {(item) => <div>{item()}</div>}
</Index>
```

Optional second argument is an index number:

```jsx
<Index each={state.list} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {(item, index) => (
    <div>
      #{index} {item()}
    </div>
  )}
</Index>
```

## `<ErrorBoundary>`

```ts
function ErrorBoundary(props: {
  fallback: JSX.Element | ((err: any, reset: () => void) => JSX.Element);
  children: JSX.Element;
}): () => JSX.Element;
```

Catches uncaught errors and renders fallback content.

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went terribly wrong</div>}>
  <MyComp />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Also supports callback form which passes in error and a reset function.

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary
  fallback={(err, reset) => <div onClick={reset}>Error: {err.toString()}</div>}
>
  <MyComp />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## `<Suspense>`

```ts
export function Suspense(props: {
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: JSX.Element;
}): JSX.Element;
```

A component that tracks all resources read under it and shows a fallback placeholder state until they are resolved. What makes `Suspense` different than `Show` is it is non-blocking in that both branches exist at the same time even if not currently in the DOM.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <AsyncComponent />
</Suspense>
```

## `<SuspenseList>` (Experimental)

```ts
function SuspenseList(props: {
  children: JSX.Element;
  revealOrder: "forwards" | "backwards" | "together";
  tail?: "collapsed" | "hidden";
}): JSX.Element;
```

`SuspenseList` allows for coordinating multiple parallel `Suspense` and `SuspenseList` components. It controls the order in which content is revealed to reduce layout thrashing and has an option to collapse or hide fallback states.

```jsx
<SuspenseList revealOrder="forwards" tail="collapsed">
  <ProfileDetails user={resource.user} />
  <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading posts...</h2>}>
    <ProfileTimeline posts={resource.posts} />
  </Suspense>
  <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading fun facts...</h2>}>
    <ProfileTrivia trivia={resource.trivia} />
  </Suspense>
</SuspenseList>
```

SuspenseList is still experimental and does not have full SSR support.

## `<Dynamic>`

```ts
function Dynamic<T>(
  props: T & {
    children?: any;
    component?: Component<T> | string | keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements;
  }
): () => JSX.Element;
```

This component lets you insert an arbitrary Component or tag and passes the props through to it.

```jsx
<Dynamic component={state.component} someProp={state.something} />
```

## `<Portal>`

```ts
export function Portal(props: {
  mount?: Node;
  useShadow?: boolean;
  isSVG?: boolean;
  children: JSX.Element;
}): Text;
```

This inserts the element in the mount node. Useful for inserting Modals outside of the page layout. Events still propagate through the Component Hierarchy.

The portal is mounted in a `<div>` unless the target is the document head. `useShadow` places the element in a Shadow Root for style isolation, and `isSVG` is required if inserting into an SVG element so that the `<div>` is not inserted.

```jsx
<Portal mount={document.getElementById("modal")}>
  <div>My Content</div>
</Portal>
```

# Special JSX Attributes

In general Solid attempts to stick to DOM conventions. Most props are treated as attributes on native elements and properties on Web Components, but a few of them have special behavior.

For custom namespaced attributes with TypeScript you need to extend Solid's JSX namespace:

```ts
declare module "solid-js" {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Directives {
      // use:____
    }
    interface ExplicitProperties {
      // prop:____
    }
    interface ExplicitAttributes {
      // attr:____
    }
    interface CustomEvents {
      // on:____
    }
    interface CustomCaptureEvents {
      // oncapture:____
    }
  }
}
```

## `ref`

Refs are a way of getting access to underlying DOM elements in our JSX. While it is true one could just assign an element to a variable, it is more optimal to leave components in the flow of JSX. Refs are assigned at render time but before the elements are connected to the DOM. They come in 2 flavors.

```js
// simple assignment
let myDiv;

// use onMount or createEffect to read after connected to DOM
onMount(() => console.log(myDiv));
<div ref={myDiv} />

// Or, callback function (called before connected to DOM)
<div ref={el => console.log(el)} />
```

Refs can also be used on Components. They still need to be attached on the otherside.

```jsx
function MyComp(props) {
  return <div ref={props.ref} />;
}

function App() {
  let myDiv;
  onMount(() => console.log(myDiv.clientWidth));
  return <MyComp ref={myDiv} />;
}
```

## `classList`

A helper that leverages `element.classList.toggle`. It takes an object whose keys are class names and assigns them when the resolved value is true.

```jsx
<div
  classList={{ active: state.active, editing: state.currentId === row.id }}
/>
```

## `style`

Solid's style helper works with either a string or with an object. Unlike React's version Solid uses `element.style.setProperty` under the hood. This means support for CSS vars, but it also means we use the lower, dash-case version of properties. This actually leads to better performance and consistency with SSR output.

```jsx
// string
<div style={`color: green; background-color: ${state.color}; height: ${state.height}px`} />

// object
<div style={{
  color: "green",
  "background-color": state.color,
  height: state.height + "px" }}
/>

// css variable
<div style={{ "--my-custom-color": state.themeColor }} />
```

## `innerHTML`/`textContent`

These work the same as their property equivalent. Set a string and they will be set. **Be careful!!** Setting `innerHTML` with any data that could be exposed to an end user as it could be a vector for malicious attack. `textContent` while generally not needed is actually a performance optimization when you know the children will only be text as it bypasses the generic diffing routine.

```jsx
<div textContent={state.text} />
```

## `on___`

Event handlers in Solid typically take the form of `onclick` or `onClick` depending on style. The event name is always lowercased. Solid uses semi-synthetic event delegation for common UI events that are composed and bubble. This improves performance for these common events.

```jsx
<div onClick={(e) => console.log(e.currentTarget)} />
```

Solid also supports passing an array to the event handler to bind a value to the first argument of the event handler. This doesn't use `bind` or create an additional closure, so it is highly optimized way delegating events.

```jsx
function handler(itemId, e) {
  /*...*/
}

<ul>
  <For each={state.list}>{(item) => <li onClick={[handler, item.id]} />}</For>
</ul>;
```

Events cannot be rebound and the bindings are not reactive. The reason is that it is generally more expensive to attach/detach listeners. Since events naturally are called there is no need for reactivity simply shortcut your handler if desired.

```jsx
// if defined call it, otherwised don't.
<div onClick={() => props.handleClick?.()} />
```

## `on:___`/`oncapture:___`

For any other events, perhaps ones with unusual names, or ones you wish not to be delegated there are the `on` namespace events. This simply adds an event listener verbatim.

```jsx
<div on:Weird-Event={(e) => alert(e.detail)} />
```

## `use:___`

These are custom directives. In a sense this is just syntax sugar over ref but allows us to easily attach multiple directives to a single element. A directive is simply a function with the following signature:

```ts
function directive(element: Element, accessor: () => any): void;
```

Directive functions are called at render time but before being added to the DOM. You can do whatever you'd like in them including create signals, effects, register clean-up etc.

```js
const [name, setName] = createSignal("");

function model(el, value) {
  const [field, setField] = value();
  createRenderEffect(() => (el.value = field()));
  el.addEventListener("input", (e) => setField(e.target.value));
}

<input type="text" use:model={[name, setName]} />;
```

To register with TypeScript extend the JSX namespace.

```ts
declare module "solid-js" {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Directives {
      model: [() => any, (v: any) => any];
    }
  }
}
```

## `prop:___`

Forces the prop to be treated as a property instead of an attribute.

```jsx
<div prop:scrollTop={props.scrollPos + "px"} />
```

## `attr:___`

Forces the prop to be treated as a attribute instead of an property. Useful for Web Components where you want to set attributes.

```jsx
<my-element attr:status={props.status} />
```

## `/* @once */`

Solid's compiler uses a simple heuristic for reactive wrapping and lazy evaluation of JSX expressions. Does it contain a function call, a property access, or JSX? If yes we wrap it in a getter when passed to components or in an effect if passed to native elements.

Knowing this we can reduce overhead of things we know will never change simply by accessing them outside of the JSX. A simple variable will never be wrapped. We can also tell the compiler not to wrap them by starting the expression with a comment decorator `/_ @once _/`.

```jsx
<MyComponent static={/*@once*/ state.wontUpdate} />
```

This also works on children.

```jsx
<MyComponent>{/*@once*/ state.wontUpdate}</MyComponent>
```
