There are only few Lifecycles in Solid as everything lives and dies by the reactive system. The reactive system is created and updates synchronously so the only scheduling comes down to Effects which are pushed to the end of the update.

We've found that developers doing simple tasks don't often think this way so to make things a little easier we've aliased a non-tracking (never reruns) `createEffect` call with `onMount`. It is just an Effect call but you can use it with confidence that it will only run once for your component, once all initial rendering is done.

Let's use the `onMount` hook to fetch some photos:
```js
onMount(async () => {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?_limit=20`);
  setPhotos(await res.json());
});
```

Lifecycles are only run in the browser so putting code in `onMount` has the benefit of not running on the server during SSR. Even though we are doing data fetching in this example, usually we use Solid's resources for true server/browser coordination.
