# Support

We would love contributions to our documentation. Writing clear, concise and easy to translate documentation for a project like Solid can be tricky. It takes a community to make this possible. We encourage you to submit translations and edits as PRs. Translations for Indonesian, Russian, German and Japanese would be especially nice!

If you feel the documentation is missing any important detail, please feel free to open an issue.
